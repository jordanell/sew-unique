  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I completed my apprenticeship for dress making and design in 1983,
      soon thereafter Sew Unique was created. I have specialized in custom fitting and
      design. If you can dream it I can make it. My reputation for quality workmanship
      has clients travelling from Vancouver, Calgary, Seattle, and beyond.

      <!-- Born and raised in Campbell River, I have always enjoyed the creative artistry
      of sewing. Since starting my business over 30 years ago, I have grown from
      completing my apprenticeship for dress making and designing,
      to creating and altering custom gowns for thousands of brides and grads.
      I specialize in custom fitting for both women and men; shaping your clothes to best suit
      your body type. -->
